Hello, my name is Hanafi and Im here to learn and talk about on of the basic concept in react

So, I know that yesterday we have already learn react, react native and component lifecycle with Mr. Rod Nolan.
And today, I will covered again because this is my job to make a presentation about some thing.
And I think this topic is very - very important concept.

So let's start

We already know, that react is component based
  - react or react native application is composed by many many of component
  - in react with component, we can split our application UI into independent and reusable
  - and each component has several lifecycle methods that will run code at particular event
  - each component follow a lifecycle methods,
  - that why component lifecycle is very impoertant if we want expert on react

there is 3 event on react component lifecycle
let's start with mounting event
mounting is event on first render or created
on mounting event, component will execute this methods :
  constructor()
    - this method is called before component mounting
    - this method is right place to init our state and our props
    - constructor method is not required on react component
      - if we don't need initialize state and bind other method we can remove constructor methods and react sill running well 
  
  componentWillMount()
    - this method is not required
    - this method is invoked immediately before initial rendering
    - because this method execute before rendering, updating state in this method will not trigger rerender process
  
  render()
    - this method is required
    - return a single react elemet such as <div />, <View /> or another react elemet
    - this methos must be pure function this means that this method does not updating component state

  componentDidMount()
    - run after initial rendering
    - run side-effects on this method like call request to API to fetch data and other
    - setting state on this method, will trigger re rendering

Updating
  componentWillReceiveProps()
    - this method will execute when component receive new props
    - in this method we can update component state that have relation with props

  shouldComponentUpdate()
    - this method is look like an question, right?
    - this method used to determine that our component need rerender or not
    - as a default, this method return true
    - to avoid rerender, we can return false in any condition
    - if this method return false, componentWillUpdate, render, componentDidUpdate will not be invoked

  componentWillUpdate()
    - is invoked immediately before rendering when new props or state are being received
    - perform preparation before update or rerender
    - cann't call this.setState here

  render()
  
  componentDidUpdate()
    - is invoked immediately after updating occurs
    - this method is not called for the initial render
    - we can operate the DOM API here

Unmounting
  componentWillUnmount()
    - is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed
    - Perform any necessary cleanup in this method
    - such as invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up any DOM elements that were created in componentDidMount
